- See that column headings are carried onto the next page.
- [Pantable ](https://github.com/ickc/pantable) uses [Panflute], e.g. https://github.com/ickc/pantable/blob/master/pantable/csv_to_table_markdown.py
- If we needed to apply custom formatting during the build, e.g. to round those floats, we could probably write our own Pandoc filter.
