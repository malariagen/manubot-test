## Test table from CSV hard-coded into Markdown content {.page_break_before}

Using the pantable Pandoc filter.

```table
---
caption: '*Awesome* **Markdown** Table'
alignment: RC
table-width: 2/3
markdown: True
---
First row,defaulted to be header row,can be disabled
1,cell can contain **markdown**,"It can be aribrary block element:

- following standard markdown syntax
- like this"
2,"Any markdown syntax, e.g.",$$E = mc^2$$
```


## Test table from CSV file source {.page_break_before}

- Using the pantable Pandoc filter with the `include` option, loading from `content/csv/by_country.csv`.
- Alignment has been specified: `LRRRRRRR`.
- 'Samples By Country' is the specified `caption`.
- `dialect: unix` is passed to `csv.reader()` by way of `csv-kwargs`


```table
---
caption: 'Samples By Country'
alignment: LRRRRRRR
include: content/csv/by_country.csv
csv-kwargs:
  dialect: unix
---


```

- See that column headings are carried onto the next page in PDF.
- See column headings are squashed/wrapped in HTML, perhaps decrease font size (e.g. wrapping in `<div style="font-size:7pt">...</div>`)
- See floats wrap
- See Year colum is so squashed that it's vertical!
- [Pantable ](https://github.com/ickc/pantable) uses [Panflute](https://pypi.org/project/panflute/), e.g. https://github.com/ickc/pantable/blob/master/pantable/csv_to_table_markdown.py
- If we needed to apply custom formatting during the build, e.g. to round those floats, we could probably write our own Pandoc filter.


## Test table from CSV file source with decreased font size {.page_break_before}

- Same as above, except wrapping in `<div style="font-size:7pt">...</div>`

<div style="font-size:7pt">
```table
---
caption: 'Samples By Country'
alignment: LRRRRRRR
include: content/csv/by_country.csv
csv-kwargs:
  dialect: unix
---
```
</div>

- This font-size change is not honoured in some local renderings of the HTML, e.g. Datalab, but does work in others, e.g. GitHub Pages and opening a downloaded copy of `index.html` in a Chrome, although it always seems to work in the PDF.
- See that the Year column is very squashed, even with decreased font size, possibly because something has to give and no preference has been given.
  - Want some level of tighter control over table formatting, at the column level.
